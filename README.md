# IBM-EdunetFoundation-Project

## About the Project
This project aims to predict the percentage of the population with access to improved drinking water sources across various regions using IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI. By leveraging demographic, environmental, and infrastructure-related indicators, the system provides data-driven insights that can help policymakers and communities improve access to safe drinking water, supporting sustainable development goals.

## Problem Statement
Access to safe drinking water is a basic human necessity, yet millions of people globally still rely on unimproved sources. This leads to waterborne diseases, poor health outcomes, and increased inequality.
There is a need for a reliable prediction system to classify whether a water source is improved or unimproved, enabling governments and organizations to take targeted, informed action.

## Proposed Solution
Using **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio AutoAI**, a regression model was developed to predict the percentage of the population with access to improved drinking water based on demographic, environmental, and regional indicators. This approach provides:
- Early detection of underserved areas
- Data-driven prioritization of water infrastructure projects
- Informed policy-making for equitable resource distribution
